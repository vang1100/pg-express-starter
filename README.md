## About This Repo

🎶 We will be building a Music Library application using the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Pg](https://node-postgres.com/) Node.js packages!

The [Pg](https://node-postgres.com/) package is a Node.js client library that allows you to interact with a PostgreSQL database. It provides an interface for executing queries and working with results returned from PostgreSQL. Pg allows you to connect to a PostgreSQL server, execute SQL statements, manage transactions, and handle connection pooling. This makes it easy to perform CRUD operations and build database-backed APIs and applications in Node.js.
